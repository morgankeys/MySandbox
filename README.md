# My Sandbox

Use this repo as a sandbox to start hacking with all the packages, features and configurations you already like.

- Use folders to section off different frameworks or environments
- Use branches to start creating something without worrying about messing up the original sandbox.
- When you discover new frameworks or configurations you realy like, figure out how to merge those back into master.
- Keep the root folder relatively clean
