# My Sandbox

Use this repo as a sandbox to start hacking with all the packages, features and configurations you already like.

- Use folders to section off different frameworks or environments
- Use branches to start creating something without worrying about messing up the original sandbox.
- When you discover new frameworks or configurations you really like, figure out how to merge those back into master.
- Keep the root folder relatively clean

# Current playgrounds:
- React - CRA app, set up with some basic styling and styled-components
- Flask-react - Tutorial for using React in Flask. Thought it might be a fun way to explore Flask.
- Processing - Trying out data visualizations and basic agent-based simulations
- Twilio - Play with text-messaging!
- Xcode - Try my hand at iOS or swift dev
