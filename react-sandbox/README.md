# About this branch
This README is for the addressee-wrapping branch. 

In this branch I tried exporing creative ways to layout long lists of users in a message recipient field. I was working on a feature that allowed user to send messages to many groups at once. When looking at messages, it was important that users be able to recall what group the recipient had been a part of.

This was an exploration of how I could show a long list of recipients in a way that optimiatzed horizontal space and scrolling without forcing the page to become excessively long when expanding many groups.

# About this sandbox-folder
This folder is for quickly building React-apps. The boiler plate is set up so that I can focus on small pieces of functionality (a button, a flex layout, etc) immediately.
