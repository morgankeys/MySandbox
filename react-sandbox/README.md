# About this branch
This README is for the main branch. The main branch should stay simple and be a great jumping-off point for experiments.

# About this sandbox-folder
This folder is for quickly building React-apps. The boiler plate is set up so that I can focus on small pieces of functionality (a button, a flex layout, etc) immediately.
